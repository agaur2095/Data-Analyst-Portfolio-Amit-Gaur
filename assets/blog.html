            <h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The impact of video communication on the world has been transformative, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video communication tools, such as Zoom and other similar platforms, rapidly became the backbone of daily operations for various industries, institutions, and individuals worldwide. During the pandemic, these tools facilitated remote work and virtual collaboration, enabling businesses to maintain operations despite physical distancing measures. This shift was instrumental in preventing economic disruptions and job losses, with many companies leveraging video communication to transition seamlessly to remote work setups. As a result, industries experienced an exponential increase in remote employees and a substantial rise in the utilization of video conferencing solutions.</p>
             
			 <h3>Impact on various sectors</h3>
			 <p>The impact extended beyond the corporate landscape, influencing sectors like healthcare, education, technology, and professional services. In healthcare, remote collaboration through video conferencing proved beneficial, leading to considerations of flexible remote work models. Educational institutions witnessed a surge in the use of video conferencing for remote learning, revolutionizing the delivery of education and expanding access to knowledge.</p>
             
			 <h3>Helped in Engagement</h3>
            <p>Teams may hold virtual meetings through technologies like Zoom, which facilitates cooperation and communication. The ability to collaborate creates teamwork and regular interaction, both of which increase interest. Applications for virtual meetings enable flexibility in working arrangements by enabling distant work. The flexibility to work from home or other locations is valued by employees and can boost engagement and job satisfaction. Surveys were carried out during the pandemic to assess worker productivity and participation. The integration of virtual meeting technologies resulted in an increase in employee engagement and efficiency.</p>
            
			<h3>Disruptive Innovation</h3>
             <p>Delivering a clear and user-friendly interface was Zoom's main priority. Users disappointed with the complexity of the current video conferencing software were drawn to it by its simplicity, dependable performance, and easy joining process (which does not require users to register accounts).Zoom used to provide a free service with restricted functionality for consumers who could not afford paid plans for advanced features. Due of its accessibility for people and small enterprises, it was widely adopted.Zoom was aware of how its consumers' needs were changing, particularly in view of the recent increase in remote work and virtual meetings.In the same way, Google's revolutionary search engine revolutionized online information access. In addition, by providing an open-source mobile platform, the Android operating system disrupted the smartphone market.</p>			
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>In summary, the introduction and broad use of video communication tools—best represented by sites like Zoom—have dramatically changed how people, organizations, and other sectors conduct business. The rapid adoption of these instruments in various businesses' daily operations was sped up by the COVID-19 epidemic. These systems enabled remote work, virtual collaboration, and seamless communication across physical limitations, all of which were crucial in preserving business continuity during these extraordinary times.</p>
